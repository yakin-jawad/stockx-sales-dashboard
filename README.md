# stockx-sales-dashboard

This is a data analysis project with the purpose of creating a sales performance dashboard for StockX. The data was provided by StockX,
specifically from their 2019 Data Contest dataset, which can be found [here](https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/), covering their
sales on Off-White and Yeezy branded shoes from 2017 to 2019. However, it's important to note that the dataset isn't an accurate representation
of their sales during those years, and it's only a sample set of their actual sales figures.

However, for realism's sake, we will act as though the values are real. Using PostgreSQL, I've pre-processed and cleansed the data to fit the
context of the project. Afterwards, I've exported the SQL database into a CSV file, and imported it into Tableau, where the brunt of the project took place.
Before beginning the project, however, I asked ChatGPT to generate a user story (which is also referenced under notes) to simulate a real-world
scenario. I've also drawn a preliminary sketch of what I'd initially wanted the dashboard to look like to have a clear vision, although I ended up
changing a few details and sections around to look visually appealing.

The end product (which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yakin.jawad/viz/stocks-sales-dashboard/SalesPerformanceDashboard), or as an image in the images section) is my first attempt at using all these technologies, making sure to reference any resources I might have used and create a dashboard which
tries to mimick StockX's very own website, utilizing their colour schemes and design philosophies.
