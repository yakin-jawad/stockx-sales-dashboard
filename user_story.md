# Sales Performance Dashboard for StockX

## Preface
I have asked ChatGPT to generate a user story by having it "act" as a stakeholder to determine key elements, features, and data visualization types to include in the sales dashboard.

## Stakeholder Requirements

**As a** sales manager at StockX, **I want** a sales performance dashboard that provides a detailed overview of our sales data from the last year, **so that** I can effectively monitor and analyze our sales performance, make informed business decisions, and identify areas for improvement.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

The dashboard must display the total sales overview for the last twelve months, including total sales revenue, total units sold, and the total average order value. It should also include a breakdown of how many sales came from Off White and Yeezy sneakers, providing a clear comparison between the two brands.

Additionally, the dashboard must feature a heat map of the US, showing which states garnered the most sales in the last year. This will help identify geographic trends and target regions for marketing and sales efforts.

Lastly, the dashboard should list the top ten most popular sneakers by sneaker name, brand (Off-White or Yeezy), total sales, average sale price, average retail price, and sale price. This information will be crucial for understanding consumer preferences and making inventory decisions.
